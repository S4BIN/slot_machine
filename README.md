# slot_machine
This code is not authored by me and also this project does not promote or endorse gambling in any way. It is purely an educational project through which I aim to incorporate certain additional functionalities. It was developed by following a tutorial[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th4OBktqK1I&list=PL2xa-cWXXKhu7Zo0tcgzXYddxH48kqy8-&index=7] provided by "Tech With Tim" to gain a deeper comprehension of the Python programming language.

Furthermore, I have extended the functionality of this code by introducing a feature that allows the player to potentially double their winnings after each spin.I will add other functionalities in the near future.
